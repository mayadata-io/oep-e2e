This test plan covers all these areas and serves as the top level guide for those who are contributing to the quality of the product.



## Test artifacts:

**Master Test Plan** - This is the master plan for planning the testing.

**Master-test-yaml** - [A coded version of this plan](https://github.com/mayadata-io/oep-e2e/blob/master/.master-plan.yml), which will allocate unique test IDs for each test case so that they are checked against the test runs in pipelines to calculate the coverage.

**Test case** - Each test case will have two parts.

- Detailed description of the test case and
- Actual implementation of the test case

**GitLab issues** - [Issues or backlogs](https://github.com/mayadata-io/oep-e2e/issues) are the entry points to the quality feedback process. These issues also serve as the tracking aids for maintaining the test plan and implementing the test cases.
