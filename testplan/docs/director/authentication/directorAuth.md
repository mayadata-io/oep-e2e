## Authentication
This page captures the test scenarios for Authentication methods supported in DOP(Director Onprem). DOP supports the following authentication methods against various Identity providers
- **Local Auth:** Credentials are validated against the Identity stored local database (MySQL) in Director.
- **Gitlab Auth:** Credentials are validated from Gitlab Identity provider using Oauth. 
- **GMail Auth:** Credentials are validated from GMail Identity provider using Oauth.
- **Active Directory Auth:** Credentials are validated against the Identities in Microsoft Active Directory using LDAP. 

### Workflow TCs
Test cases covered for the all the above authentication methods are as mentioned below,
- Admin Authentication - Admin will have option to enable and disable users. This will be available for Local Auth and AD Auth only.
- User Authentication - Regular users will have access to the portal. They will have different roles based on teaming. Roles and access control will be covered in [Teaming](/docs/director/teaming/directorTeaming)
- Signup Feature
- Password Complexity check
- Profile field validation
  - Username field validations. First name, Last name, Boundary condition for  min, max chars, unique identity, case sensitive
  - email field validation. Type validation, unique identity
  - Roles (optional)
  - Company (optional)
  - Phone (optional)
  - Profile status updation

### Edge Cases
[WIP]
- AD with SSL configured is not supported
- IDP server is down and authenticate the same
- IDP server taking time to respond

### Scalability
[WIP]

- 50000 Simultaneous login


### Performance
[WIP]

- Success page after authentication should be loaded with in 10 sec with 100 simultaneous login/sec
