## OpenEBS
As a DevOps admin, I want to deploy OpenEBS in a Kubernetes native way. I would like to deploy OpenEBS on nodes that are meant to serve storage. I want to be notified if any particular node or the entire cluster is not capable of deploying & running OpenEBS. I want OpenEBS to discover all the storage disks that it can consume in order to expose them as kubernetes persistent volumes. I want OpenEBS to provide recommendations in selecting disks that ensure data availability in-case of disk as well as node failures.

This page captures the test strategies for OpenEBS operations related to:
- Install
